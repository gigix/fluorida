#summary Release 0.0.1 Announcement

I'm glad to announce that [http://code.google.com/p/fluorida/ Fluorida] 0.0.1 (the first preview release) is out.

Fluorida is a Flex/Flash functional testing tool. It manipulates Flash just as real users do. It allows testers write test cases with simple but still expressive DSL. What makes Fluorida different is that it doesn't rely on `mx.automation` package, which is only available in [http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/features/flex_builder/ Flex Builder Professional Edition]. 



Stomperl 0.0.1 (the first preview release) is out.

Stomperl [http://code.google.com/p/stomperl/] is an implementation of Stomp [http://stomp.codehaus.org/] broker with Erlang. That means performance, scalability, reliability and elegance in concurrent programming are our goals. And since Stomp is simple enough, it's a good start point to learn Erlang/OTP programming.

Version 0.0.1 is the first preview release. The main purpose is to gather feedbacks from the community. So far it supports basic elements in Stomp protocol: CONNECT, DISCONNECT, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, SEND and RECEIPT. It passes acceptance tests built with both Java and Perl clients. That's why I consider it as "usable" and decide to announce it.

To give Stomperl a try (NOTE: EUnit later than 2.0 beta is required):

   1. Check it out with Subversion: svn checkout http://stomperl.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.0.1/ stomperl-0.0.1
   2. Kick off the broker: make startup
   3. Now you can connect to the broker at port 61613. However I suggest you run the test suite first: make test

What's next? I suppose Stomperl will support full Stomp protocol in its 0.0.2 version, along with a better test coverage. We will do more acceptance test, compatibility test and performance test in the future. But first, any suggestion and feedback would be highly appreciated.
